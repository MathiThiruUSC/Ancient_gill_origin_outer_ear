We split the dataframe into training and test data as follows: human outer ear and nose cartilage cells as our training set and zebrafish gill cartilage and jaw hyaline cartilage cells as our test set. We used the random forest classifier from the scikit-learn library52 to distinguish human outer ear (elastic) and nose (hyaline) cartilage cells using their gene expression information. We evaluated various hyperparameter configurations (e.g. varying number of trees in the random forest and maximum depth of any tree) for the random forest using a grid search with repeated stratified k-fold (5 folds and 5 repetitions). Several configurations achieve perfect accuracy on the training set, but we report the configuration that performed best on the test set. This configuration used the default values set by the scikit-learn library except that it consisted of 512 instead of 100 trees. To ensure robustness, we initialized our random forest configuration with 100 different random seeds, trained it on the human data, and then tested it on the zebrafish data. The average accuracy over these 100 different initializations was 62.34% with a standard deviation 3.26%. Finally, we plotted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
